        "# GRPO is a policy optimization algorithm that aims to improve the policy relative to a baseline or other policies.

        "# - Exploration vs. Exploitation: During training, it's important to balance exploring different `similarity_top_k` values (e.g., by having sufficient variance in the output distribution or using techniques like entropy regularization) with exploiting values that have yielded high rewards.\n",
        "# - Clipping Gradients: Clipping gradients can prevent exploding gradients, which is important for training deep neural networks.\n",
        "# - Regularization: Techniques like weight decay or dropout can help prevent overfitting.\n",
        "# - Reward Scaling: Scaling the rewards can help in stabilizing the training process.\n",
        "# - Replay Buffer (in Actor-Critic methods): While pure policy gradient might not use a replay buffer, actor-critic variants (like A2C or A3C, which are related to GRPO concepts) often use them to improve sample efficiency and stability.\n",
        "# - Target Networks (in Actor-Critic methods): Using target networks can improve stability in actor-critic methods.\n",
        "# - GRPO Specifics: Implementing GRPO fully would involve additional considerations like maintaining a group of policies, comparing their performance, and potentially using a trust region or proximal policy optimization approach to constrain policy updates. A simplified approach focusing on relative improvement over iterations via a baseline is often a practical starting point.\n",
        "\n",
        "# In summary, the training involves an iterative process of sampling questions, executing the policy-controlled RAG, calculating rewards, and updating the policy network's weights using a policy gradient method guided by the cosine similarity reward and potentially incorporating baseline subtraction and other stability techniques."

        "*   The `RAGPolicyNetwork` was successfully modified to output parameters (mean and log-variance) for a Gaussian distribution over `similarity_top_k`.\n",
        "*   Functions were successfully implemented to sample `similarity_top_k` from the predicted Gaussian distribution and calculate the log probability of the sampled action, including handling the conversion from a continuous sample to a discrete, positive integer.\n",
        "*   A function to calculate the mean reward as a baseline was successfully implemented and tested.\n",
        "*   A training loop structure was successfully set up, integrating the policy network forward pass, action sampling, a placeholder for RAG execution and reward calculation (using a dummy reward for demonstration), baseline calculation, advantage computation, policy loss calculation, backpropagation, and optimizer steps.\n",
        "*   The core policy update steps (`backward()` and `optimizer.step()`) were confirmed to be correctly integrated and executed within the training loop.\n",
        "*   An evaluation process was implemented to test the trained policy, showing that the policy network predicted `similarity_top_k` values (10 and 11 in the example) and resulted in an average cosine similarity reward of 0.3299 on the evaluation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current low average reward (0.3299) suggests that the policy is not yet effectively learning to choose `similarity_top_k` values that maximize cosine similarity. Further refinement of the reward function, action space handling, or policy network architecture is needed.\n",
        "*   Implementing the actual RAG execution and cosine similarity reward calculation within the training loop is the crucial next step to train the policy network on real rewards rather than a dummy reward. This will require integrating the RAG system (using `OECD_index` and `agent`) into the training loop's batch processing.\n"

        "*   The training process successfully logged key metrics at both the batch and epoch levels to Weights & Biases, including policy loss, average reward, average predicted `similarity_top_k`, average advantage, average mean, and average log-variance of the predicted distribution.\n",
        "*   Hyperparameters such as learning rate (1e-4), batch size (8), and number of epochs (100) were successfully logged to the Weights & Biases config.\n",
        "*   The training loop executed for 100 epochs, with console output confirming the progress and epoch-average loss and reward.\n",
        "*   A new epoch-level metric, the standard deviation of the predicted `similarity_top_k`, was successfully added and logged to provide insight into the variability of the policy's actions.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   Visualized the logged metrics in the Weights & Biases dashboard to analyze trends, identify correlations between metrics (e.g., reward and predicted top\\_k), and diagnose potential training issues such as instability or convergence problems.\n",
        "*   Implement the actual RAG system reward calculation to replace the dummy reward function, allowing the policy to learn based on real retrieval performance.\n"
