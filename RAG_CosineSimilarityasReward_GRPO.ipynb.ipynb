        "# - Clipping Gradients: Clipping gradients can prevent exploding gradients, which is important for training deep neural networks.\n",
        "# - Regularization: Techniques like weight decay or dropout can help prevent overfitting.\n",
        "# - Reward Scaling: Scaling the rewards can help in stabilizing the training process.\n",
        "# - Replay Buffer (in Actor-Critic methods): While pure policy gradient might not use a replay buffer, actor-critic variants (like A2C or A3C, which are related to GRPO concepts) often use them to improve sample efficiency and stability.\n",
        "# - Target Networks (in Actor-Critic methods): Using target networks can improve stability in actor-critic methods.\n",
        "# - GRPO Specifics: Implementing GRPO fully would involve additional considerations like maintaining a group of policies, comparing their performance, and potentially using a trust region or proximal policy optimization approach to constrain policy updates. A simplified approach focusing on relative improvement over iterations via a baseline is often a practical starting point.\n",
        "\n",
        "# In summary, the training involves an iterative process of sampling questions, executing the policy-controlled RAG, calculating rewards, and updating the policy network's weights using a policy gradient method guided by the cosine similarity reward and potentially incorporating baseline subtraction and other stability techniques."

        "*   The `RAGPolicyNetwork` was successfully modified to output parameters (mean and log-variance) for a Gaussian distribution over `similarity_top_k`.\n",
        "*   Functions were successfully implemented to sample `similarity_top_k` from the predicted Gaussian distribution and calculate the log probability of the sampled action, including handling the conversion from a continuous sample to a discrete, positive integer.\n",
        "*   A function to calculate the mean reward as a baseline was successfully implemented and tested.\n",
        "*   A training loop structure was successfully set up, integrating the policy network forward pass, action sampling, a placeholder for RAG execution and reward calculation (using a dummy reward for demonstration), baseline calculation, advantage computation, policy loss calculation, backpropagation, and optimizer steps.\n",
        "*   The core policy update steps (`backward()` and `optimizer.step()`) were confirmed to be correctly integrated and executed within the training loop.\n",
        "*   An evaluation process was implemented to test the trained policy, showing that the policy network predicted `similarity_top_k` values (10 and 11 in the example) and resulted in an average cosine similarity reward of 0.3299 on the evaluation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current low average reward (0.3299) suggests that the policy is not yet effectively learning to choose `similarity_top_k` values that maximize cosine similarity. Further refinement of the reward function, action space handling, or policy network architecture is needed.\n",
        "*   Implementing the actual RAG execution and cosine similarity reward calculation within the training loop is the crucial next step to train the policy network on real rewards rather than a dummy reward. This will require integrating the RAG system (using `OECD_index` and `agent`) into the training loop's batch processing.\n"
